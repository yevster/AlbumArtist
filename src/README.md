# Album Artist

I needed a quick tool to edit album art on music files. So I made one, and by "made", I mean wrote a paper-thin GUI around Mono's amazing `TagLib-Sharp` library.

## How to Install ##

Run `setup.exe` to install, or just extract the directory somewhere and run `AlbumArtist.exe` to start the app.

## How to use ##

1. Run the application.
2. Drag&Drop some music files onto the application
3. In the Browse dialog that opens up, select the desired album art.
4. There is no step 4. Enjoy!

If you're running on Mac or Linux, try running the application with [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/). I have not tested it myself, but it's worked well for me with similar apps.
